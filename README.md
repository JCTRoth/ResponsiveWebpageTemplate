# WebpageTemplate

This template is a boilerplate for Webpages:

- This HTML5/Bootstrap/JQuery Web-Template containing solid and nice frameworks (mainly JS).

- The "Template" Code is heavily commented.

- All Frameworks/Libraries are updateable by the pagemanager NPM.

- Development Tools like ESlint are on board and can be installed by a seperate Flage.

- For development, you can use any IDE of you want,
 however a VisualStudio Code Workspace is preconfigurated.

How to set the Page up for Development:

**cd**  /Template Folder

**npm install**

<br>

If you want to Upload the Page:

**npm prune --production**
 
 This removes all Development Tools (ESlint etc.)
