# Responsive Webpage Template

This template is a boilerplate for Webpages:

- This HTML5/Bootstrap/JQuery Web-Template containing solid and nice frameworks (mainly JS).

- The "Template" Code is heavily commented.

- It contains a lot of good CSS configuration.

- All Frameworks/Libraries are updateable by the pagemanager NPM.

- Development Tools like ESlint are on board and can be installed by a seperate Flage.

- For development, you can use any IDE of you want,
 however a VisualStudio Code Workspace is preconfigurated.
